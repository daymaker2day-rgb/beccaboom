# 🔧 Gemini AI Troubleshooting Guide

## ❌ Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: "API Key Not Configured"
**Cause**: Environment variable was on same line as comment  
**Fixed**: ✅ Moved `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` to its own line in `.env.local`

**Before:**
```bash
# Gemini API ConfigurationVITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAMWtB8...
```

**After:**
```bash
# Gemini API Configuration
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAMWtB8sAX6TCBJ048B18Jkb-_RLJO5c2g
```

### Issue 2: API Not Loading in Development
**Cause**: Environment variables not being read on startup  
**Fixed**: ✅ Added proper `import.meta.env` access and dev server restart

---

## 🚀 Current Status
