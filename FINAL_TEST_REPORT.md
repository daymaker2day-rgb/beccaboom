## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Notification doesn't appear
**Solution**: Check browser console (F12) for errors. Verify z-index is not blocked by other elements.

### Issue: Buttons don't respond
**Solution**: Clear browser cache, refresh page, check console for JavaScript errors.

### Issue: Watermark changes don't persist
**Solution**: This is by design - data resets on page refresh. Add localStorage to persist.

### Issue: Comments disappear on refresh
**Solution**: This is by design - comments stored in React state only. Add localStorage to persist.
